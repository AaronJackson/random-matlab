This is for the mathsy-version of Wordle, Nerdle.

~nerdle.m~ attempts to find all valid 8 digit equations. It took about
18 hours to run in Octave. The output is included as
~nerdle_output.mat~. However, this output includes integers prefixed
with zero(s), which is kind of cheating, and I don't think these are
actually valid for Nerdle.  The script ~filter.m~ will remove those
cases.

Despite this, I still end up with 67346 equations. 41857 of these
resolve to zero, so if we exclude these, we end up with 25489 (these
are stored as ~filtered_nonzero.mat~).

Some other interesting stats:

- The biggest number you can make is 891.
- The number of unique answers is 456.
- The most common answer is 9, making up 1635 of the 25489 equations.
